# BambooHR Calendar Sync

This project defines a Google Apps Script project that can be used to sync
leave information from BambooHR to a Google Calendar.

The script will create all-day events in Google Calendar that correspond to
the Who's Out items published in BambooHR, for approved leave.

Events will only be synced to Google for specific employees, whos emails have
been added to the access list for the Google Calendar. This allows teams to
have their own Google Calendars and easily see team mates' leave there, without
being distracted by time off booked by other employees outside of the team.

# Usage

Create a new standalone script on [script.google.com](https://script.google.com/)
manually or via `clasp` and push `Code.js` and `appsscript.json` from this
project.

Go to _Project properties_ > _Script properties_ in the online editor and add the
following environment variables

  * `googleCalendarId` - ID of the Google Calendar to publish the events to, will
    be something like `1234abcd@group.calendar.google.com`
  * `bambooCompanyDomain` - BambooHR sub-domain registered for your company, without
    the `.bamboohr.com` suffix
  * `bambooApiKey` - API key for connecting to BambooHR, can be generated by any
    user from your profile page

Run the function `syncBambooHRWhosOutToGCal()` from the code editor manually, or
create a trigger to execute this on a schedule automatically.
